In Uriz-Uharte (2023), I explore the impact of ICT adoption in large organizations. By decreasing communication costs, ICT alleviates coordination problems in the internal organization of large corporations. I find this has a significant impact fostering firm innovation and patenting, which in turn brings an increase in firm productivity. These results help to understand the nature of the innovation process as a company-wide endeavor that requires the combination of knowledge inputs from workers with different specializations. Whereas most of the innovation literature has focused on studying firm and market incentives for innovation, neglecting a systematic empirical analysis of firm innovation capacity, this article helps to fill this gap by showing evidence of (i) the importance of firm organizational capacity for innovation activities; and (ii) how technologies can help to overcome limitations in organizational capacity and, as a result, raise innovation.
