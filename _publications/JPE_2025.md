We empirically investigate how the performance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) changes when gaining access to market information. Our analysis is based on a unique information-sharing program launched by a major bank, which provided SME customers with detailed, comparative reports on their own sales and customer profiles relative to nearby competitors. Leveraging comprehensive transaction-level data, we estimate that program adoption leads to a 9% increase in SME revenues. We find that SMEs use the newly acquired information to target previously underserved demographic groups and attract customers from new geographic areas. Importantly, smaller and less sophisticated firms experience higher returns, suggesting that access to actionable information can help close performance gaps between firms. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of data-driven decision-making in leveling the playing field for SMEs in competitive markets.
