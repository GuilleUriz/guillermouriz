In order to understand the nature of firm market power in intermediate input and labor markets, we study the determinants of the prices that firms pay for their inputs. Traditional studies on monopsony power rely on demand shift instruments to estimate supply elasticities and infer monopsony power from an upward-sloping supply curve. Our research builds on this approach, showing that if input prices and wages are influenced by bargaining processes, demand shocks may no longer be valid instruments. To address this problem, we leverage uniquely rich and highly disaggregated data from textile firms in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. This data includes transaction-specific prices for every purchase of intermediate inputs and detailed information on employment levels and wages by occupation-education categories. By relaxing the stringent assumptions of prior work, we identify novel forms of market power. Our findings reveal that market power manifests in ways that challenge conventional interpretations offered by mainstream monopsony literature.
